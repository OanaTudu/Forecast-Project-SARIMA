# Forecast-Project-SARIMA
project on price forecasting for construction materials using seasonal ARIMA in python


The data for this project consists of price information in time series format for 5 materials: steel, rebar, glass, concrete and plywood, for the period 2007-2018. The goal is to predict the prices of these materials in the next 6 months and to make recommendations on when to buy and wether to stock for saving (to avoid buying when the price will likely be high). 

I used python and a seasonal ARIMA model to approach the problem.
